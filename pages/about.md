Simon Pepin Lehalleur (a.k.a. me) has just moved to Berlin, and is currently looking for a postdoc position in algebraic geometry.

Here is a [CV]({{ site.url}}/resources/cv_en.pdf) and a [picture]({{site_url}}/resources/img/profile.png).

In previous years, I have completed a PhD in mathematics in Algebraic geometry in [Zürich](http://www.math.uzh.ch/) under the great guidance of [Joseph Ayoub](http://user.math.uzh.ch/ayoub/). More about this [here]({{site_url}}/research).
